function name: add_digital_ids 
@params: private digital_object: Struct{}

What it does?
1. It saves the params Struct into the mapping of key_to_userID
2. Mapping key is user's public address


function name: update_digital_ids 
@params: private digital_object: Struct{}

1. First checks if already stored or not, if not throw error
2. Updates entire thing not just the one

IMPORTANT
For update of any one field like i want to update my twitter id 
I need to supply entire Struct 


function name: get_digital_ids_hash 
@params: private digital_object: Struct{}

1. It would first return the BHP:256 hash aka fields
of the Struct
2. It then checks with the mappings by doing the key val retrieve
3. Again hash's the retrieved Struct and checks wether
the user params Struct hash is equal to retrieved Struct Hash

IMPORTANT
If you supply different Struct than the time of add_digital_ids
then the hash differs and throws error. Which implies that
it's the same info stored on-chain as the off-chain backend
